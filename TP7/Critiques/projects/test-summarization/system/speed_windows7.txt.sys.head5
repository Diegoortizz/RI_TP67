Performance wise it is slightly faster than Vista and I'm talking 10 to 15 seconds difference for starting the computer, other computers I have the run on Linux still start in less than 1 quarter the time that Windows 7 does .
Very robust and extremely fast, I can find and open programs or files by just hitting  window  on the keyboard   and typing in the first few letters of the thing I want to open and Win7 almost instantaneously finds what I'm looking for .
Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use .
I own XP Professional and wanted a nice, clean install of Win7 so I didn't have a bunch of legacy files hanging around to slow down Win7 so I reformatted the HD before doing the Win7 install .
I can finally use adobe CS4, before with Vista 32bit photoshop cs4 wouldn't run so smoothly as cs3 but now it opens faster and is just working great .
It might do that on vista   but I got the trojans recently and haven't been using vista as much since it's on a slow HP mini netbook that gets sickeningly hot to the touch .
I ordered the upgrade disc from HP and tried 3 times to upgrade to Vista, but all 3 times I had problems with it being too slow, buggy, and my software games printer didn't work .
I am very happy with the program, it is much faster, I upgraded from Windows xp, the bad part is there is no driver available to install for my HP wireless printer to work .
It does boot up faster than Vista, I do like the taskbar at the bottom as you can  pin  icons to start all of your programs and you can start a program with the desired file opening .
