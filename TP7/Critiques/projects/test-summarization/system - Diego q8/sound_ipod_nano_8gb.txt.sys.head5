i was surprised, b c thats one of the downsides i found through time from other customers, but im happy with the quality of sound, i also think adding noise cancel, ear buds phones would greatly improve the sound .
Long Battery Life, Sleek Compact, Easy To Set Up, Reliable Performance, Great Sound, Lots of Storage bought it for the gym and it was just the right weight !
Easy to use, Great sound, long battery life, love the fact that I can tune in to my favorite radio station, and I'm into exercise so the pedometer with calories burned is a great addition .
Only things I wish they added is measuring distance [not just steps] on the pedometer, better sound on the speaker, and a  capturing still images  with the video recording feature .
I notice that the audio playback has improved alot over the previous generations I could hear hissing in the third generation and didn't really remember how if sounded on the fourth generation because I didn't have it along time .
