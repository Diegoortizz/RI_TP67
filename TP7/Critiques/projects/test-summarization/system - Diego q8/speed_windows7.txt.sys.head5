Performance wise it is slightly faster than Vista and I'm talking 10 to 15 seconds difference for starting the computer, other computers I have the run on Linux still start in less than 1 quarter the time that Windows 7 does .
Very robust and extremely fast, I can find and open programs or files by just hitting  window  on the keyboard   and typing in the first few letters of the thing I want to open and Win7 almost instantaneously finds what I'm looking for .
Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use .
I own XP Professional and wanted a nice, clean install of Win7 so I didn't have a bunch of legacy files hanging around to slow down Win7 so I reformatted the HD before doing the Win7 install .
